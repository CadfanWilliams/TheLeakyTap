# Booking Website for a Pub

## Requirements

The website should have two views: Admin and User.

Users can request, view, edit, or cancel bookings.

Admins can view all bookings and choose dates, times, and names.

Users cannot book a table if there's no room available.

## Ideas

- Users can select their preferred area if the booking size is large enough.
- The website can have a menu and pre-ordering function.
- Users will receive a confirmation email or text.

## UPDATES

The first draft of this project has too many errors. Instead of testing my knowledge, I'm constantly updating software or using command line tools on Mac while watching someone do it on Windows, which is not ideal.

I'm considering starting over with the app on Windows. Once it's no longer necessary, I'll post it to GitHub and pull it to my Mac.
