# Booking Website for a Pub

## Requirements

The website needs to have two roles: ADMIN and USER. 

Users should be able to request bookings (CREATE), view their bookings (READ), edit their bookings (UPDATE), or cancel their bookings (DELETE). 

Admins should be able to view all bookings and select dates, times, and names.

Users should not be able to book a table if there is no room available.

## Ideas

- Users can see the layout of the pub and choose their preferred area if the booking size is large enough.
- The website can also have a menu and a pre-ordering function.
- Users will receive an email or text confirming their booking and reminding them of their reservation
    
    ## UPDATES
    
    The first draft has too many errors. Every obstacle I encounter is not even a test of my knowledge; I'm simply updating the dependency version or using Mac CLI to download software, while watching someone do it on Windows, which is not ideal.
    
    I'm considering starting over with the app on Windows. Once it's no longer necessary, I'll simply post it to GitHub and pull it to my Mac.
